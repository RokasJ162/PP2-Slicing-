This program takes user image and slices it verticaly then merges the slices and forms two images. 
Program then proceeds to slice two images horizonatly thus forming additional four images (see "sliced image.jpg").

**It is crucial that the image that user wants to slice would be in the pythons project folder. Otherwise program will not work. **

In the json config file user has an option to adjust height and width of the slices.
